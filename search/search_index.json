The following lists each, and details: whether or not they are registered by default; and how to enable them if not. DiFactory Laminas\\ServiceManager\\Di\\DiFactory creates and returns a Laminas\\Di\\Di instance. If the config service is present, and contains a top-level di key, the value of that key will be used to seed a Laminas\\Di\\Config instance, which will then in turn be used to configure the Di instance. By default, this factory is mapped to the service name DependencyInjector , and aliased to Di . Configuration for the service should follow the rules for Laminas\\Di\\Config . DiServiceFactory Laminas\\ServiceManager\\Di\\DiServiceFactory provides a laminas-di-backed factory that will use the name provided and attempt to create the relevant object instance. The constructor accepts three arguments: $di , a Laminas\\Di\\Di instance. $useContainer , one of the class constants USE_SL_BEFORE_DI , USE_SL_AFTER_DI , USE_SL_NONE , as detailed below. The factory composes the Di instance, and uses the $useContainer value to determine how to attempt to create the instance, according to the following rules: If USE_SL_BEFORE_DI is provided, the factory will attempt to fetch the service from the passed container first, and fall back to the composed DI container only on failure. If USE_SL_AFTER_DI is provided, the factory will attempt to fetch the service from the composed DI container first, and fall back to the passed container only on failure. If USE_SL_NONE is provided (or no argument is passed), then the factory will only fetch from the composed DI container. While you can use the factory directly, doing so requires seeding it with a configured Di instance. In most cases, you will use the DiAbstractServiceFactory instead, as detailed in the next section. DiAbstractServiceFactory Laminas\\ServiceManager\\Di\\DiAbstractServiceFactory provides an abstract factory that will, on invocation, pull the requested class from the composed Laminas\\Di\\Di instance. It extends DiServiceFactory to provide the utilities necessary to act as an abstract factory. When determining if a requested service can be created, it does the following, in the following order: Checks if a shared instance is already present for the requested service in the DI instance manager. Checks if an alias exists for the requested service in the DI instance manager. Checks if configuration exists for the requested service in the DI instance manager. Checks if type preferences exist for the requested service in the DI instance manager. If none of the above return true, it then: checks if a class definition exists for the requested service; checks if the requested service is an interface name. If none of the above return true, it will not attempt to create the requested service. If the service can be created, creation follows the rules outlined for the DiServiceFactory . DiAbstractServiceFactory is registered under the service name DiAbstractServiceFactory by default. To register it as an abstract factory in your code, you will need to manually register it. This will typically be done via one of your application modules, within the onBootstrap() method: class Module { public function onBootstrap($e) { $app = $e->getTarget(); $services = $app->getServiceManager(); $services->addAbstractFactory($services->get('DiAbstractServiceFactory')); } } This should typically be done in a module registered early, to ensure it happens before many services are pulled from the container. DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory Laminas\\ServiceManager\\Di\\DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory works similarly to DiAbstractServiceFactory and DiServiceFactory , with a few key differences. First, unlike DiAbstractServiceFactory , it directly extends Laminas\\Di\\Di ; as such, it acts exactly like Laminas\\Di\\Di , except where it specifically overloads functionality. Second, it implements a whitelist ; if the requested class does not exist in the whitelist, the abstract factory will not attempt to create an instance. This latter is useful for creating a scoped Di instance. As an example, when pulling controllers, you may be tempted to use a :controller segment in your routing; having a whitelist ensures that if a user requests an arbitrary classname for the controller, the abstract factory will not attempt to create an instance! DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory is registered under the service name DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory by default. To register it as an abstract factory in your code, you will need to manually register it. This will typically be done via one of your application modules, within the onBootstrap() method: class Module { public function onBootstrap($e) { $app = $e->getTarget(); $services = $app->getServiceManager(); $services->addAbstractFactory($services->get('DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory')); } } This should typically be done in a module registered early, to ensure it happens before many services are pulled from the container. By default, DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory is consumed by Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\ControllerManager ; if the abstract factory is detected, it is added as an abstract factory to the ControllerManager instance. Thsu, by default, the factory for building the DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory instance checks for configuration under di.allowed_controllers ; this should be an array of controller names to add to the service: return [ 'di' => [ 'allowed_controllers' => [ 'Some\\Controller\\Name', ], ], ]; You can use DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory in other locations as well, and with other configuration. Consider using delegator factories in order to seed the DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory : public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container, $name, callable $callback, array $options = null) { $diStrictAbstractFactory = $callback(); $config = $container->has('config') ? $container->get('config') : []; if (! isset($config['application_di_class_whitelist'])) { return $diStrictAbstractFactory; } $diStrictAbstractFactory->setAllowedServiceNames($config['application_di_class_whitelist']); return $diStrictAbstractFactory; } DiServiceInitializer Laminas\\ServiceManager\\Di\\DiServiceInitializer is a laminas-servicemanager initializer , and can be used to initialize instances after they've already been pulled from the container. This functionality can work with invokable services, or to augment existing factories in your laminas-servicemanager configuration. Because the initializer requires a Laminas\\Di\\Di instance, as well as the parent application container, it is registered with laminas-servicemanager, and you will need to retrieve it and add it as an initializer manually, typically in an application module's onBootstrap() method: class Module { public function onBootstrap($e) { $app = $e->getTarget(); $services = $app->getServiceManager(); $services->addInitializer($services->get('DiServiceInitializer')); } } We do not recommend using this functionality, as initializers are run for every new instance retrieved, and the functionality could conflict with existing factories for services.","title":"Services"},{"location":"services/#services-provided","text":"laminas-servicemanager-di provides a number of factories and services that integrate laminas-di into laminas-servicemanager .
